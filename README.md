# password-generator
Welcome to the README.md for my password-generator

Using the javascript we have learned in the class from the last few weeks

I wrote the javascript to make a working password-generator.

This password generator allows the user to choose from 8-121 character length

and include upper case, lower case, numeric, and symbols in the password.
